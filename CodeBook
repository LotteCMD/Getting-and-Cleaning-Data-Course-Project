Final assignment for getting and cleaning data


The following dataset is used for this assignment: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

Summary: 
  - The dataset contains results from an experiment
  - The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
  - Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
  - Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
  - The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.


Variables (tidy dataset):
  - subject: Subject performing the activity, ranges from 1-30
  - activity: Activity the subject is performing (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing or laying) 
  - measurement variables: tBodyAcc-mean()-X up to (and including) fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std(). Each variable is the mean value of all measurements recorded for every unique combination of variables subject and activity.


Transformations: 
  1. First of all the dataset was downloaded into R.
  2. The relevant datasets are loaded into R by means of read.table.
  3. The test and training datasets were merged, based on rows (rbind).
  4. Columnnames were added to the variables in the merged dataset of totalSet, using the featuresName datasets. 
  5. Only the columns with measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted from the totalSet dataset.
  6. Columnnames were added to the variables of the other merged datasets.
  7. The three datasets that were merged on rows, are now merged on the columns. This results in one single dataset, named mergedDataTables
  8. Descriptive activity names were added to activity variable instead of displaying a number.
  9. A new data set was created and saved (tidyData) with the average of each variable for every unique combination of variables activity and subject.
